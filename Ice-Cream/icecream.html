        Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has
        been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a
        spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or
        peaches. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and
        stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals
        from forming. It can also be made by whiskin a flavoured cream base and
        liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that
        is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more
        malleable as its temperature increases.
